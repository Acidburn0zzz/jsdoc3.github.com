<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>

<p>
    <code>@borrows &lt;that namepath&gt; as &lt;this namepath&gt;</code>
</p>

<h3>
    Overview
</h3>

<p>
    The @borrows tag allows you to add documentation for another symbol to your documentation.
</p>

<p>
    This tag would be useful if you had more than one way to reference a function, but you didn't want to duplicate the same documentation in two places.
</p>

<h3>
    Examples
</h3>

<p>
    In this example there exists documentation for the "trstr" function, but "util.trim" is just a reference to that same function by a different name.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Duplicate the documentation for trstr as util.trim</b>
</p>
