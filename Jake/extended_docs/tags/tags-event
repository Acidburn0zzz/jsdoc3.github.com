<h3>
    Syntax
</h3>

<p>
    <code>@event &lt;className&gt;#[event:]&lt;eventName&gt;</code>
</p>

<h3>
    Overview
</h3>

<p>
    The @event tag allows you to document an event that can be fired. A typical event is represented by an object with a defined set of properties.
</p>

<p>
    Once you have used the @event tag to define a specific type of event, you can use the @fires tag to indicate that a method can fire that event.
</p>

<p>
    JSDoc automatically prepends the namespace <code>event:</code> to each event's name. In general, you must include this namespace when you link to the event in another doclet. (The @fires tag is a notable exception; it allows you to omit the namespace.)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: JSDoc 3 uses @event doclets to document the content of an event. In contrast, JSDoc Toolkit 2 used @event doclets to identify a function that can be fired when an event of the same name occurs.
</p>

<h3>
    Examples
</h3>

<p>
    The following examples show how to document an event in the <code>Hurl</code> class called <code>snowball</code>. The event contains an object with a single property.
