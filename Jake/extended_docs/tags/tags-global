<h3>
    Overview
</h3>

<p>
    In cases where the static analysis feature of JSDoc is not able to derive the scope that you intend purely from the code surrounding your doc comments, you can use the @global tag to explicitly specify that a symbol should appear in the documentation as a <em>global</em> symbol.
</p>

<h3>
    Examples
</h3>

<p>
    Use the @global tag to specify that a symbol should be documented as global.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Document an inner variable as a global</b>
</p>
