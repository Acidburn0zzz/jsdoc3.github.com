Before editing the user guides for JSDoc 3, please consider these notes:

- This site is built from data files and templates
- To add or modify content you must make changes in the `Jake/extended_docs` folder
- If you create a new file in the extended documentation then you must create a new `Jake\articles` file and include the extended documentation. See any of the other articles for an example of how it's done.
- giving the article file name an appropriate prefix will automatically add it to the index page. The supported article prefixes are `about-`, `contribute-`, `howto-`, and `plugins-`. Please do not use the `tags-` prefix or your article may be deleted in a future build.
- Before committing, build the HTML by running the `jake` command in the project root

If you contribute to a user guide, please add your github name and a link to your github page (only), at the bottom of the guide.

Thank you!
